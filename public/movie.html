<h3>TWILIGHT</h3>
<p>Alright I know, it is too much of a romantic kind of movie,
   since the list is mine i am the boss here. This movie has a deep impact on
   me. I love a lot of things about it.</p>

<h3>HARRY POTTER</h3>
<p>Again this mine seem like a childhood kinda of movie, but Harry 
    Potter was one of the best movie i have seen. The background music,
    the environment everything was soo cool about this movie.

    franchise. The background music again is so nostalgic.
